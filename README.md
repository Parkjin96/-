We use "map my walk" app data

# My perpose(preprocessing)
I want find data mining from people position data(x,y point).
but this position data have wrong movement data.
Ex) If someone stays tsill, the location data has to just one data(not movement).
    However some data showed so big movemet. So I have to delete these data
